# Hi there! I am Daniel Brendel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior indie software developer and project founder from Germany.

I love creating complex software products across a range of fields, including web development, game development and application development. While I work with many programming languages, PHP and C++ are my main ones. Over the years, I've founded various projects and am excited to create more. I have strong expertise in designing and building complex software ecosystems. I'm furthermore an open-source advocate and passionate about promoting the values of Free and Open-Source Software.
